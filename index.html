        <p>
            This is a collection of projects that I made to practice my web development skills.
            These projects were made by following freeCodeCamp's excellent
            <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/full-stack-developer/">
                Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum</a>.
            The Workshops section in each chapter contains guided projects that are
            provided in the curriculum to introduce various html+css
            concepts to learners.
            On the other hand, the Labs sections
            contain projects that I've made to pass freeCodeCamp's
            rigorous user stories to get through their course.
